# Data Validation

1. If you haven't already, please run `bash unpack_data.sh` from the root repository directory (Src_EHT - just one level above this directory). 
2. In order to produce the plots that validate the data, please open up the `ReproducePlots.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. 
3. Once opened, run all of the cells.
   - If certain plots are desired, there are instructions to indicate what sections correspond to those plots. 
   - They will create plots of the data at refined or coarse levels.

### Options for Reproducing Different Plots:
1. High and Low Frequencies for Each Day _**(8 Plots Total)**_
2. Combined High and Low Frequencies for Each Day _**(4 Plots Total)**_
3. Replica of Paper IV: Figure 1's subplot _**(1 Plot Total)**_
   - _**Recommend running this section because this validates what is in the original paper!**_
