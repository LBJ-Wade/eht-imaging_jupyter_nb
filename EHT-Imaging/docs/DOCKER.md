## Instructions to build the final Docker container from the base Dockerfile given
___TODO: Remove these instructions once the final image is in the GCLab Dockerhub.___
They should be removed because they require root access. The dockerfile could also be removed because it will be unneeded once the final container is available to pull from the GCLab Dockerhub.

In order to build the Docker container from the Dockerfile, follow the instuctions given in [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0BHBwIYek05tYM9tgasxkV6F0ErbxWVpKTfZ-RJwG8/edit?usp=sharing) Google Doc.
