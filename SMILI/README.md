***Progress of reproducing the black hole image with SMILI library (with comparison to SMILI image from Paper IV)***
<br>
<br>

The SMILI pipeline is one of three pipelines (along with DIFMAP & EHT-Imaging) used to produce the first image of a black hole in M87. This project aims to provide findings about the reproducibility process of reconstructing an image of a black hole using SMILI's software. The ```smili``` repository contains the python scripts and its outputs (tested using a virtual machine with Ubuntu 18.04). The ```post-processing``` respository contains further edits needed to better resemble the image as shown in Paper IV.

## Acknowledgement 
Special thanks to the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration and SMILI development team for allowing the public to have access to the M87 data and pipeline code. This project was possible with the mentorship of University of Tennessee's [GCLabs](https://globalcomputing.group/research.html). I highly suggest anyone interested in astronomy (or even the STEM field) to try this out as it's quite rewarding in many aspects.
